[![Tourism Website](./tourism/src/Components/readmePic/tourismWebsite.png)](https://np-project-33535.web.app/)
## Country: Nepal
Even though I have a Belgian Nationality, I am originally from Nepal. So, I wanted to create a website about Nepal to honor my childhood memories. 
## Color Palette

## Tools
- React 
- Material UI
- Firebase real-time database
- Deployment: Firebase hosting

## Things that are completed
### Home page
- Card information fetched from database
- Like/ unlike feature is authenticated
- One user can only access their own like/unlike list
- Articles can be read with and without logging in 
### Connect page
- Sign up and log in pages are completed with authentication
### Responsive layout
- Everything done so far has a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Below you can see example from home page for xs screens, sm screens and higher, and lg screens and higher

## Currently working on
### Profile page
- favorites list will be created
## Next 
- Searchbar
## Things I want to improve later

- keeping the card length same. Right now, in some cases, the card length fluctuates due to the different amount of words in each card
- Include password validation for connect page as well as improve other validations
